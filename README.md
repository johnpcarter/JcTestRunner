## JcTestRunner

Automatically scans all of your packages looking for wm test suites, run them and copies the results to the JcTestRunners pub folder so that you can view the tests online i.e.

```
http://<host>:<port>/JcTestRunner
```

or ping it with
```
http://<host>:<port>/rad/jc.test.runner:api/ping
```

response : NONE, TODO, COMPLETED, FAILED

to block until done
```
http://<host>:<port>/rad/jc.test.runner:api/status/{waitInterval}/{maxWaitCount}
```

response: NONE, COMPLETED, FAILED

you can even pull the test results if you donâ€™t want to use the web page.
```
http://<host>:<port>/rad/jc.test.runner:api/instances/pull 
```

if you don't want to run all test cases then you can specify which package to test when starting the container via the following environment variable.

```
-Dis_package=JcHelloWorld
```

### Running tests manually

If you don't want to run packages automatically then set the global variable

```
jc.test.runner.manual=true
```

in which case you will need to run tests manually via the service

```
jc.test.runner.services:run
```

which will run all tests by default unless you provide the name of the package you wish to test
via the package input.

or via the API (all packages)

```
http://<host>:<port>/rad/jc.test.runner:api/run
```

or specifically for a package such as JcHelloWorld
```
http://<host>:<port>/rad/jc.test.runner:api/run/JcHelloWorld
```
